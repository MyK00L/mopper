# mopper
An optimization library mainly meant to be used for contests like AtCoder Heuristic Contests or like Google Hash Code.

## Project goals
- speed
- flexible enough so that many solution types can be efficiently implemented
- ease to implement a problem with some traits and test it quickly with many approaches
- automatic search and selection of parameters
- automatic comparison and chaining of different approaches
- ILP tools
- SAT tools
- small codebase and no external dependecies for the main part (could have optional dependencies for external ilp/sat solvers)
